# hello! this is where you manage which jekyll version is used to run.
# when you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. run jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# this will help ensure the proper jekyll version is running.
# happy jekylling!
