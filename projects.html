            <h2>Lazy Circles</h2>
            <p class="stand-out">Small town folks living simple lives the most difficult way possible.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Goshé, a small town with a big purpose. The wheelchair-bound mayor only votes “no”. The town librarian is burning all the books. The weatherman who smells bad weather is losing his sense of smell. The police have been fired. Citizens Arrest is in effect. The town pervert is on the loose. A tornado is coming. And the windmills are throwing off the town’s equilibrium, causing everyone to pass out at the same time. Follow these characters and many more as their stories cross paths on a journey to save the town they love the only way they know how: by completely destroying it. Inspired by true stories and experiences from Emmy winning brothers Marcus and Lucas Ross.</p>
